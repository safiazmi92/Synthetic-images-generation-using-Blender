# Synthetic-images-generation-using-Blender
create a synthetic image generator which will be used to train Deep Learning models, in the domain of documents understanding.
First, we will create a 3D scene by projecting original 2D document images into 3D meshes. Then
we will generate 2D images from varying camera, light, and background conditions. For this task
we will use Blender.
